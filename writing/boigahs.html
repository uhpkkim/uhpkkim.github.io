<br>a hot girl kept feeding me boigahs until i got sleepy
<br>then she kept trying to make out with me as i was falling asleep
<br>she said she likes it when the girls she makes out with are full of boigahs
<br>i don't know how true that is, but they were bogo they were buy one get one free
<br>the hot girl bought em all and then she got all the rest free
<br>
<br>i finally fell asleep and dreamed about some mummies trying to rob a bank
<br>i woke up and the hot girl was still trying to make out with me
<br>as we were making out she was on her phone dialing 1-800-bogo-boigahs
<br>
<br>i fell back asleep again and she entered my dream through my mouth
<br>i was dreaming that i was falling asleep at my job at the bank
<br>she came in and kept trying to make out with me at my job at the bank
<br>but i was worried about making out with someone while on the clock
<br>i didn't wanna get fired because I needed the money to get new tires
<br>for my bicycle that i had used to bike to her apartment back in the awake world
<br>i've been saving up for a bicycle that can ride itself
<br>
<br>she was starting to tell me I should take all the trash from my job home
<br>so she could use it for an abstract sculpture she's working on
<br>i asked her to explain the abstract sculpture using only words and sentences
<br>but before she could get to the third vague shape description,
<br>the mummies finally showed up to rob the bank and then i woke up again
<br>
<br>when i woke back up there was this hot girl making out with me
<br>i told her i had to bike home so i could dream on my own mattress by myself
<br>she reminded me that my bicycle had two flat tires from when we were bicycling down the fallsway and we ran over a bag of broken glass that an old polish lady had dropped in the road because she had gotten startled because she thought she had seen the apparition of her long lost lover stepping out of a toyota corolla
<br>
<br>the hot girl told me she would call me an uber
<br>i told her i was allergic to yams but then she said uber again and then I understood what word she said
<br>
<br>the uber driver took the most imaginary route to my destination
<br>it was like he did the whole thing upside down
<br>on the car radio, i heard a news report
<br>apparently interpol is hunting down a hot girl
<br>because her abstract sculptures contain too many illegal vibes
<br>
<br>when i got home and exited the uber I accidentally left all my leftover boigahs in the back seat
<br>i tried to call uber to retrieve my lost luggage,
<br>but the driver had apparently disappeared immidiately after he drove away from my house
<br>
<br>the next morning I felt so bloated from the night before
<br>on the phone, the hot girl says she can put me in touch with a boigah doula
