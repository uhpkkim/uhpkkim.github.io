        <br><br>Instead of doing any sort of Inktober variant, every day I come up with a new idea or prompt but I don't actually make the thing or even consider making it.
        <br><br>If any other people choose to make the things I come up with, who am I to stop them?? This is a commentary I guess?? About the algorithmic and demanding nature of art on social media platforms but also my own struggle to accept that I can't commit to every cool idea I come up with.

<b><u>
1.</u></b> A fictional zine reviewing the water at various sinks, water fountains, and restaurants. Maybe in a city full of Warriors-style gangs. I will not be making this.

<br><br><b><u>
2.</u></b> A line of casualwear that makes it look like the wearer is currently melting. Maybe even including masks. I will not be making this.

<br><br><b><u>
3.</u></b> Comic or short graphic novel about two guys named Mike who are unicorn hunting exclusively for a third Mike. [[[I offered that the title aught to be a pun on My Chemical Romance but couldn't figure out how to get it to work, and was given 2 options from instagram followers" - Michael Michael Romance; Mike and Michael Romance. (Album and Mike Allison) I will not be making this.

<br><br><b><u>
4.</u></b> Video-game that stops periodically to nag you to do your chores. I will not be making this.

<br><br><b><u>
5.</u></b> Fashionable fingerless gloves with a stigmata design on them. I will not be making this.

<br><br><b><u>
6.</u></b> (This one was verbatim a dream I had that night) A TV show/book/comic/etc - A medical drama/comedy about a small health clinic that's secretly a front/disguise for a clinic for demons, spirits, the supernatural, etc. The front-facing human side of the clinic has a history as the only clinic in the city that would treat queer people dating back to the 80s, and the supernatural side acts as sort of a metaphor for that. Partly in that the clinic doesn't discriminate and will treat any spirit or demon (even if they're nasty, vengeful, a trickster, etc) that nobody else wants to respect or take care of. The main character is a queer woman that works on the front-facing human clinic, who chose to work there because of its queer history. She's kind of clueless at first and doesn't realize for a while that she's working at a spirit clinic, even though it's comically obvious to the viewer. I will not be making this but somebody should.

<br><br><b><u>
7.</u></b> A dating app that give you a little notification any time you and someone else both swipe LEFT on eachother. Like, (party popper) "You and Geraldine have no interest in one another!" (party popper), or (party popper) "Mario doesn't like you EITHER!"(party popper). I will not be making this.

<br><br><b><u>
8.</u></b> (This is more just a thing I wish existed) A website (in a similar vibe to discogs, rateyourmusic, jumptheshark.com) that tells you which album to start with when trying to get into a band/artist you've never really listened to. Other thoughts and features it could have: what album to listen to second, third etc; distinctions between good album to listen to first vs what album is best or most significant; a little explanation about different distinct eras in their discography; comments sections; maybe all of this is based on fan voting. I will not be making this.

<br><br><b><u>
9.</u></b> Dildo matryoshka dolls. Like, they get smaller and smaller and at the end there's a real littleo ne. I will not be making this.

<br><br><b><u>
10.</u></b> Like a paddleball, but it's a golf driver or a baseball bat so you can smash the ball and then it comes back to you and you can keep smackin it real hard and probably injure yourself. I will not be making this.

<br><br><b><u>
11.</u></b> Black box theater / small expirimental theater stage play about Steve Irwin traveling back in time to stop the dodo from going extinct. I will not be making this.

<br><br><b><u>
12.</u></b> Professional wrestler persona named Toby Real whose entrance music is Got To Be Real by Cheryl Lynn. I will not be doing this.

<br><br><b><u>
13.</u></b> Uhh, I don't know like... an entirely jetski-themed concept album (and... accompanying risograph artbook?) inspired by Wave Race 64 and Jet Moto vibes. I will not be making this.

<br><br><b><u>
14.</u></b> [note: the thing at the end of a website (.com, .net,. org, etc) is called a "top-level domain" or "tld"] A new top-level domain specifically for spoofing-scam websites that you end up at if you misspell the URL: ".con" that way if you accidentally typo a website and type .con instead of .com, someone can use that to replicate the website and CON you!! I will not be making this.

<br><br><b><u>
15.</u></b> Toy keyboard for cats/dogs/pets where all the notes are always in major pentatonic and only plays one note at a time (or maybe more than one only if they're harmonically diatonic) so instead of atonal dissonance, it just sounds like your cat is playing ethiopian tezeta jazz or something. And maybe it automatically quantizes the timing if you have a beat playing. I will not be making this.

<br><br><b><u>
16.</u></b> A 26-song album where every track is just a different letter of the alphabet and all the vocals are just the sound of that letter. I will not be making this.

<br><br><b><u>
17.</u></b> One of those complicated long rpg board games with a lot of cards and tiles (I'm picturing something kind of like Splendor) where you play as the Minions, and you serve a series of historical dictators and evil-doers and try not to accidentally get them killed in cartoonish ways. (or maybe the goal is you DO want to kill them) All real historical figures with real historical details about real events but all the art is in that bland Illumination 3d style. I will not be making this.

<br><br><b><u>
18.</u></b> A big awkward fandom wiki for local bands/musicians. I will not be making this

<br><br><b><u>
19.</u></b> Coming-of-age movie set in the 90s or early 00s about a trans teenager transitioning except it's also shot, written, acted, and edited like a corny 90's movie as well. Basically, what if the trans representation tipping point happened like 20 years earlier? Some possible scenes include: a bully saying "I don't fight girls" and the main character punching him; definitely a montage of him trying on baggy jeans, getting frosted tips, practicing acting and looking like a cool little tough guy in the mirror, all set to "Walk Like a Man" by the Four Seasons. I will not be making this but I think about it a lot.

<br><br><b><u>
20.</u></b> Shazam but for scents. I don't think the technology for this exists. I cannot make this.
